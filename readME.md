# Team Generator

## Description

This has been created in order to streamline the process of creating a team based on User Input. Upon the user inputting the information for each employee they would like to assign to the team, the generator will input the information provided into cards which populates on a html file for viewing. This project continues to reinforce how to work within node and creating dynamic code based on user input. I learned a lot about classes and even more about tests. I was stuck on how to make tests for the longest time, however with the help of my teacher and fellow students offering advice I was able to grasp the tests. Being able to test your classes is imperative to ensuring that your code will work the way it is intended, as the objective is when given a specific input there should be an equal output. 

## Installation

## Credits

Big shout out to my teacher and classmates this week on helping me get through the tests. After doing the readme, I was confident I could handle the HTML and dynamic coding but without their help I would have been stuck on the tests even longer than I was.
